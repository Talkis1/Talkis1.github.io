Hello, I am a Mechanical Engineering Master's student in the [Human-Enabled Robotic Technology (HeRo) Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/herolab/) at the University of Texas at Austin. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, where I was involved with [Longhorn Racing](https://www.longhornracing.org/), as well as [ASME](https://www.utasme.org/) and their intramural teams.

Experience
------
After my undergraduate graduation in December 2020 I worked at [Infinity MEP+S Consultants](https://infinitymep.com/) and [O'Connell Robertson](https://oconnellrobertson.com/) as a Mechanical Engineer. I completed projects with teams of engineers and architects for commercial, medical, and education facilities. I was directly responsible for collaborating with the end user, specifying equipment, writing the control logic, and designing HVAC and Piping systems. 

I have three internship experiences, two with [Dover Fueling Solutions](https://www.doverfuelingsolutions.com/) and one with [Southwest Research Institute (SwRI)](https://www.swri.org/). At Dover I helped design mechanical hardware to either provide for a customer, or improve upon existing mechanical designs to improve cost efficiency. At SwRI I worked in the automotive controls group where my primary roles were data analysis and developing control software to improve efficiency in automotive vehicles. Our group was involved in combustion, electric and hydrogen based vehicles.

Research
------
I am involved in two different research projects in the HeRo lab. One of the projects looks at pneumatic gripping of textile materials using the end effector of an industrial robot arm. For this project I am advised by [Dr. Ann Majewicz Fey](https://www.me.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/amfey) and [Dr. Roman Mykhailyshyn](https://romanmykhailyshyn.github.io/). 

The other project I am involved in looks at improving proprioception during fetal surgery. Two other graduate students and I are developing a surgical training system with a haptic robotic device and hololens in a unity environment. Replicating the surgical procedure to improve proprioception and cut down on time during surgery.
