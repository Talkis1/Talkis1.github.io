This project was part of the Advanced Mechatronics course at UT Austin. I was on a team with three other graduate students. The class project was to build and program a robot to shoot golf ball sized foam basketballs at one of three small hoops. 

Under each hoop there is an infrared emitting "beacon". The beacon that is emitting is the one you are supposed to shoot at and the professor chooses which beacon to emit. We had two designs that we built and tested; a fly wheel and a conveyor belt. Due to the balls not being uniform in density, the flywheel was less accurate. 

Our robot had the following:

- TI MSP432 LaunchPad similar to an Arduino Uno
- Bump sensors tells you if you bump into a wall
- Infrared sensor for line following
- Infrared sensors for the beacon
- Ultrasonic sensors for wall detection

This project was part of a class competition. Our team won this competition making 9 out of 10 shots in the finals.
