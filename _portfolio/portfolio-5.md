This project was part of the Human Centered Robotics course at UT Austin. 

Myself and one other graduate student developed a simulation for a bipedal robot to walk down a hallway and avoid both objects in the hallway and running into the walls of the hallway. Our project was inspired by this [research](https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/PRELUDE/).

Much of our code for the actual walking of the robot was developed through class homeworks and we edited it as needed. We also took a lot of code from the [research](https://ut-austin-rpl.github.io/PRELUDE/).

This simulation was developed using [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/).
