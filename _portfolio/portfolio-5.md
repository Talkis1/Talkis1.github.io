This project is part of my Master's research and is advised by Dr. Ann Majewicz Fey and Dr. Roman Mykhailyshyn. It builds upon Dr. Mykhailyshyn's existing [research](https://romanmykhailyshyn.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/).

Gripping and manipulating cloth and textiles by robotic systems in manufacturing has been a problem. The aim of this research is to develop and optimize gripping devices and their manipulation methods.

The setup for this testing is a pneumatic gripping device connected to the end effector of a Yaskawa dual arm robot. The air delivered to the gripping device is controlled by a relay and Arduino micro. The robot and arduino are controlled through ROS. Attached to the gripping device is a force sensor. This research is expected to be completed early 2024 and published through a conference paper.
