Designed and manufactured a hood style door prop. The existing design was not installed, they just used a bar. This bar was getting lost when mechanics came out and fixed some of the interior electronics. They asked me to design a low cost door prop that could be installed in the gasoline dispensers. I conducted FEA analysis for stress failure and designed with a factor of safety of 3, as requested by the engineer I was working under.
