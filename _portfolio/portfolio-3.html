Through the HeRo research lab at UT Austin, myself and two other graduate students developed a fetal surgery simulation to help train surgeons. During the twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) 
surgeons often have difficulty with proprioception, or the ability to sense the position of their hands. This is due to the fact that the surgery is performed through a small incision in the mother's belly
and the surgeon must use a fetoscope that has a camera attached to the end and it can be difficult to see. 

We developed this simulation in the Unity gaming engine and used a Geomagic Touch haptic device. The haptic and visual fixtures were programmed in C#. This simulation is still being worked on and we plan
to integrate the hololens as requested by the surgeon we are working with.
