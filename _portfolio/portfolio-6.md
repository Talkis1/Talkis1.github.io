On Longhorn Racing I was a part of the aerodynamics team in 2019-2020 where I was responsible for the front wing as well as helping other members with their designs in SolidWorks. We completed CFD analysis in Ansys to iteratively improve upon our design. The plan for manufacturing was to have a foam core with carbon fiber on the exterior. Covid prevented us from completing the manufacturing.

I was a part of the manufacturing team from 2022-2023 where I manufactured parts for the car. Often I would ask the different design teams what they needed manufactured and they would send me part drawings or SolidWorks models and then I would manufacture them. I would commonly use the lathe, mill, and the CNC milling machine. During the Fall when we had free time we typically spent it welding.
