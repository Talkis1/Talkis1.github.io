Designed for a specific consumer within the UT Mechanical Engineering department.

The key design aspects of this project was a minimal footprint (ability to sit on top of a desk) and the ability to pour a cup of water into the ice maker and receive ice in under 15 minutes. We created a MATLAB model to verify if producing ice in under 15 minutes was feasible. Our designs for the ice making mechanisms were inspired by our research through current patented products.

Three different styles of ice would be expected to be made from this; the Sonic style, crushed, and cubed.
