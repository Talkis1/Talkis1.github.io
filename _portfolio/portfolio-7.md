This was an end of semester project for a course called Composites Design. This project was done with another student at UT Austin.

For this project, our task was to design a composite sandwich structure for use in an electric
vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Specifically, we designed a portion of the wing, with
dimensions 0.15m wide and 1m long. It was given that this structure was subject to a Fx = 50
kN, Fy = 50 kN, and Nxy = 50 kN*m. The design safety factor was 1.5. 

Here is the repository for the python code that was developed for this project:
