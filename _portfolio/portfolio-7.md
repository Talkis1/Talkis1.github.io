This was a project during my senior year of my undergraduate degree at UT Austin. I was on a team with three other students. We collaborated to design this solar water still that was designed as a low cost method for countries with low access to potable water and plenty of sunlight. This design utilizes a parabolic mirror to concentrate sunlight onto a black aluminum pot. We designed this in SolidWorks and completed FEA analysis on the legs for both the still and the pot to determine the sizes we needed. We also developed a MATLAB model to see how long it would take for the pot to boil water.
